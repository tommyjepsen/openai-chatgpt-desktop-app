## OpenAI's ChatGPT in a desktop app

Get OpenAI's ChatGPT in a mac app, that is always easily accessible within your OS!

It is essentially just a new browser window, that loads chat.openai.com, but it will allow you to keep it as an .app, so you can have it in your dock bar and always have it next to you.
